# WSUWP Platform Vagrant Configuration
#
# This is the development Vagrantfile for the WSUWP Platform project. This
# Vagrant setup helps to describe an environment for local development that
# matches the WSUWP Platform production setup as closely as possible.
#
# We recommend Vagrant 1.4.3 and Virtualbox 4.3.x

  # Automatic Hosts Entries
  #
  # In the following section, we make use of two plugins for Vagrant to add network hosts entries
  # to both your local (host) machine and the virtual (guest) machine. Only the default domain,
  # wp.wsu.edu in this configuration, is provided.
  #
  # Add a `custom-wsuwp-hosts` file to this Vagrant directory and provide additional hosts there
  # when required. These should be added as one host per line.

  # that are found into a single array.
